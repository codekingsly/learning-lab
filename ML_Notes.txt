Preprocesisng: 

	Non-numerical values:
		Nominal -> Categorical Data with no inherent order or ranking & No comparison -> one-hot Encoding
		only check equality (same/different -> Male/Female). Arithmetic or comparison like <, > doesn’t make sense.
		column expansion will happen

		Ordinal -> Order & comparision -> Label-Encoding
		Categorical data that has a natural order or ranking, but the differences between values are not measurable or consistent.
		You can compare order (High > Medium), but you cannot say the “gap” between them is equal

How to do lable encoding
(independent,dependent, test_size=0.3,random_state=0) ->random_state?
SVM
DT-Entropy->Randnomness, information Gain->should be high,cost function vs Gini Index, Gain Ratio
Purning, overfiting, underfitting
hypertuning parameters
Random Forest -> Ensemble Learning, Bagging or Bootstrap Aggeregation, Random Feature Selection


If dataset contains both nominal and ordinal, how to do encoding

How to do cross validation if no parmaters eg Multiple Linear regression

How to do standardscaler if train_test_split is not used i.e using gridsearchcv
